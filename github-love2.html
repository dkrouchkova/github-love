		<summary>What is GitHub?</summary>
		<div class="expandme">
			<p>GitHub is an online space to share, download and edit code within a community of developers. Making an account is free and all of your work is public, meaning anyone can download your code, learn from it, make it better and upload it again. </p>

			<p>Each project you create lives in a repository (a file with its own url to hold all of your project folders and files). Each repository should contain a css, img, and js folder. The way to make a repo - after you’ve made an account - is to click on the plus sign at the top right corner of the page and select “New Repository.” You’re then asked to give it a name and description. You can chose to start it with a README document if you aren’t importing a repo from your local drive. There is also an option for a “.gitignore” file which keeps a log of things that you don’t want to be tracked. This is a bit complicated, so I wouldn’t worry about it just yet. Then you click “Create Repository” and you’ve got it!</p>

			<p>When you are working on your project files on your computer and have committed the changes, are finally ready to upload them to your existing GitHub repo (of the same name - it’s case sensitive) you can do it from the command line with this: “git push origin master”. You’ll be prompted to enter your username and password and it will upload to the matching repo. For a new repository upload from the command line: “git remote add origin http://github.com/yourusername/repositoryname.git”, then enter username and password and the following: “git push -u origin master” and you’re good to go.</p>

			<p>This is the basic overview of GitHub. Below is a love letter to GitHub to give you a more abstract idea of what it is.</p>

		<p>Dear GitHub,</p>

		<p>I wasn’t into publicly displaying affection in relationships until I met you. You’re so social and everyone loves you. You’ve got an expansive network of people who work with you and share the things they make with others they meet through you. It is intimidating to be around you, but it’s driving me to be better and come out of my shell somewhat. Your friends are so much cooler than mine. And there are so many to choose from. </p>

		<p>At first it was slow between us. I didn’t understand you very well. And you instantly make everything public and if that wasn’t enough to make me nervous, you insist on keeping track of how many times we talk. It’s weird, but that makes me want you to like me more. You have people who talk to you like all the time. And it’s like millions of them. How can I love you when you have millions of others who love you more than me? </p>

		<p>But then I realized I was being selfish. Love is infinite and must be shared. And that’s what you’re all about: sharing what people have created and love. It’s not about winning your love, or winning at all. It’s just about making an account and sharing the code I make with other people who will find it useful, or just stumble upon it and are inspired to make it better, or learn from it and help me learn in turn. You’re a beautiful thing, GitHub. I’m so glad to have met you and everyone else you know.</p>

		<p>I want to make beautiful things with you.</p>

			<p>Vastly endless affection,</p>
